# Core
- remove uses of exceptions
- allow to end game initialization with an error
- turn subsystems' global variables to stack objects ?

# ECS
- entity processing: add a function to process only the first entity
- entity processing: allow to specify component types as constraints without passing the values to the system function
- entity processing: allow to specify component types that should not match as constraints
- allow to remove entities (manually call the component destructors)
- allow to add and remove components from entities on the fly

# Rendering
- fix the texture origin mismatch between DDS and OpenGL
- make depth clamping shader specific instead of camera specific

# Shader
- add a diffuse only shader
- include a diffuse color in the material block
- add an error shader used in place of a shader that failed to compile

# Mesh

# Uniform buffer

# OpenGL
- add missing wrapper functions and use them instead

# Math
- make the matrix methods free functions

# Performance improvement
- pass ranges of components to system functions instead of individual components
