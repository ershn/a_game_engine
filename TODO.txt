# Math
- make the matrix methods free functions

# ECS
- entity processing: add a function to process only the first entity
- entity processing: allow to specify component types as constraints without passing the values to the system function
- entity processing: allow to specify component types that should not match as constraints
- allow to remove entities (manually call the component destructors)
- allow to add and remove components from entities on the fly

# Shader
- add an error shader used in place of a shader that failed to compile

# Mesh
